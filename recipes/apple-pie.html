        <h3>Homemade apple pie</h3>

        <p>This recipe guarantees apple pie with perfectly cooked <del>(not mushy)</del> apples 
            surrounded by a thickened and gently spiced sauce all baked inside a flaky, golden-brown crust.</p>

        <h3><ins>Ingredients:</ins></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 small Granny Smith apples, or as needed</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>1 <del>(9 inch)</del> double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><ins>Steps:</ins></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and core apples, then thinly slice. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add flour and stir to form a paste; cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add both sugars and water; bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan.</li>
            <li>Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch.</li>
            <li>Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.</li>
            <li>Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound.</li>
            <li>Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, 
                using longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the edges.</li>
            <li>Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're almost falling off the pie.</li>
            <li>Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips, 
                then unfold the first and third strips back into their original position.</li>
            <li>Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back.</li>
            <li>Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicularly over top.</li>
            <li>Unfold the second and fourth strips back into their original position.</li>
            <li>Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry.</li>
            <li>Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch to secure.</li>
            <li>Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, making sure it seeps over sliced apples.</li>
            <li>Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it doesn't run off the sides.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
